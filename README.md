## 💟 Background
In South Korea, a significant portion of the 400,000 registered deaf individuals are married, and the majority of their children, known as CODAs (Children of Deaf Adults), are hearing. 
<br>

> <b>Challenges faced by CODAs </b> <br>
CODAs face challenges such as identity confusion in navigating a mixed cultural and linguistic environment, and they often bear the burden of facilitating communication between the deaf and hearing communities. 
<br>

> <b> The Need for CODA to Learn Sign Language </b> <br>
Recognizing the importance of effective communication, there is a need for CODAs to learn sign language actively. Learning sign language fosters communication with their deaf parents, reducing difficulties and preventing emotional isolation. Adequate interaction with parents during early childhood is crucial for the linguistic and emotional development of CODAs.

<br>

## 💟 Project Overview

> <i> 'Connect the Silent World and the World of Sounds'</i>

`COM-MA` is an "AI camera-based sign language learning education platform" that helps deaf parents teach sign language directly to their children, <b>CODAs</b> (Children of Deaf Adults).
<br><br>The `COM-MA` Lens recognizes sign language and quickly converts it into learning materials for deaf parents. It offers these parents the opportunity to engage in sign language education with their children in everyday life.
